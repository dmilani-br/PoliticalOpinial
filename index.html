      <h1>Political Opinion</h1>

      <p>
        The world is shaped by political decisions, yet public opinion often
        remains invisible. Political Opinion is a neutral platform created to
        observe and understand global political sentiment.
      </p>

      <h2>Neutrality</h2>
      <p>
        This project does not seek to influence opinions, promote ideologies,
        or guide political decisions. It exists solely to observe.
      </p>

      <h2>Global Conflicts</h2>
      <p>
        Conflicts shape nations, economies, and societies. Political Opinion
        presents them transparently, allowing collective sentiment to emerge
        without interference.
      </p>

      <h2>World Leaders</h2>
      <p>
        Political leaders play central roles in global affairs, yet public
        perception is diverse and complex. This platform captures those
        perceptions without amplification or suppression.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Individual expressions are collected anonymously and visualized
        collectively. No rankings, no recommendations, no persuasion.
      </p>

      <h1>Russia × Ukraine</h1>

      <p>
        The conflict between Russia and Ukraine represents one of the most
        significant geopolitical crises of the 21st century, involving
        sovereignty, security, and global stability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Political Opinion does not endorse positions or outcomes. It observes
        public sentiment surrounding the conflict without judgment.
