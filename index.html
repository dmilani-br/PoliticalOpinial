      <h1>Political Opinion</h1>

      <p>
        The world is shaped by political decisions, yet public opinion often
        remains invisible or distorted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Political Opinion is a neutral platform that reveals public sentiment
        through the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each transaction represents a sincere individual perspective,
        expressed freely without surveys, manipulation, or intermediaries.
      </p>

      <h2>Neutrality</h2>
      <p>
        No ideologies. No endorsements. No influence over decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Readers express their opinion by trading digital assets linked to
        global political events and leaders.
      </p>

      <h1>Russia × Ukraine</h1>

      <p>
        The conflict between Russia and Ukraine represents one of the most
        significant geopolitical crises of the 21st century.
      </p>

      <p>
        Political Opinion does not endorse positions or outcomes. It observes
        public sentiment expressed through decentralized markets.

    <h1>Hamas × Israel</h1>

    <p>
      The Israel–Hamas conflict is rooted in decades of political, territorial,
      and humanitarian tensions in the Middle East.
    </p>

    <p>
      It encompasses issues of security, governance, civilian protection,
      and international law, affecting both regional stability and global
      diplomatic relations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Political Opinion does not promote narratives or outcomes. It exists
      solely to observe how global sentiment emerges through decentralized
      market expression.

      restrictions, and questions of sovereignty.
    </p>

    <p>
