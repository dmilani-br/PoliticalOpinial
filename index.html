        <h1>Political Opinion</h1>

        <p>
          Political Opinion is a neutral and independent platform created to
          observe and understand global political sentiment.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project does not seek to influence opinions, promote ideologies,
          or guide political decisions. Instead, it provides a transparent
          environment where public sentiment can emerge organically.
        </p>

        <p>
          By aggregating individual expressions, Political Opinion allows
          collective perspectives to be visualized and reflected upon —
          without judgment, endorsement, or persuasion.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          Observation, not influence. Transparency, not manipulation.

        <h2>Global Conflicts</h2>
        <p>
          Major geopolitical conflicts reflect competing narratives, interests,
          and principles. This platform presents them transparently, allowing
          collective sentiment to be observed without interference.

          In future phases, political sentiment may be expressed through
          opinion-linked digital assets, reflecting conviction through
          transparent and observable market dynamics.

        <h2>Russia × Ukraine</h2>

        <p class="context">
          The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is rooted in historical,
          political, and geopolitical tensions that intensified in 2014 and
          escalated into a full-scale war in 2022.

            <h3>Russian Perspective</h3>
            <p>
              Russia argues that NATO expansion toward its borders represents
              a direct threat to its national security. The Kremlin also claims
              historical, cultural, and strategic ties to Ukrainian territory,
              particularly in eastern regions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="side">
            <h3>Ukrainian Perspective</h3>
            <p>
              Ukraine asserts its sovereignty as an independent nation and
              views Russian actions as violations of international law.
              The Ukrainian government emphasizes its right to choose its
              political and economic alliances.

          This platform does not endorse either position. It exists solely to
          observe and understand public sentiment regarding global events.
